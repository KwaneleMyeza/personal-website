            <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a passionate software developer and tester with a love for solving problems through technology.  
                I specialise in Python and Django for back-end development and enjoy writing clean, maintainable code. 
                Iâ€™m also experienced in automation testing using tools like Selenium and QF Test, 
                which helps me ensure that software works reliably and efficiently.<br/><br/>

                Over time, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to mentor aspiring developers and review code, 
                which not only allowed me to help others grow but also deepened my own understanding of best practices. 
                I enjoy working in collaborative environments, bringing ideas to life, and learning from the people I work with.<br/><br/>
                
                When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually diving into something creative like drawing, listening to music, or curled up with a good book. Iâ€™m currently open to new opportunities â€” 
                feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to connect!<br/><br/>
